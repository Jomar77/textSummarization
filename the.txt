Based on the article created by Alloway  (1995), Heavy metals can be defined as metals with density greater than 5gcm-3. It can also be referred to as metals discharged by industry, of which the metalloids such as Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr), Mercury (Hg) and Nickel (Ni) are listed by European Commission as greatest hazards to plants and animals. Furthermore, their research yielded that heavy metals in soils continue to rcceceive increasing attention due to the greater understanding of their toxicological importance in ecosystems, agriculture and human health, the growing scientific and public awareness of environmental issues and the development of even more sensitive analytical techniques to measure their concentrations accurately.
