The Alan Turing story is so fantastic that it was inevitable that somebody should make a movie about it. His life is both inspiring and horrifying. I was fascinated at the story of Turning and his team’s work to break the German code, in order to bring the Second World War to swift close. Without the help of modern technology, they built a “computer” to decipher it.
There is one more element in the film’s depiction of Turing’s life that might have made his existence quite difficult. Once the Enigma code was broken, the British couldn’t use every intercepted communication to thwart German war plans; the Germans would have soon realized the code had been deciphered and would change it. Well, the computers that we benefited today is the result of Alan’s efforts and intelligence. He is a mathematician that’s why he created his machine in which that machine is one of the roots of our modern computers.
Clarke is as much of an odd duck as Turing—and perhaps even brighter—as the lone female involved in deciphering Enigma. Since it is considered “indecorous” for a single woman to work and share living quarters alongside men, she must sneak about to contribute to the effort.   
Alexander and the others have no success in decrypting the German cipher machine, a task made very difficult because the codes are changed every 24 hours. Turing, after much thought and experimentation, decides that the best approach is to build a machine that can beat the Enigma machine at its own game. When the Navy Commander refuses to take him seriously, Turing sends a letter to Winston Churchill who puts him in charge of the project. He immediately fires two people and welcomes Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), whose quick mind has made her a wizard at crossword puzzles and mathematical conundrums.
